## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Run the generator

To run the code generator, execute the following command:

```
dart run build_runner build
```

For Flutter projects, you can also run:

```
flutter pub run build_runner build
```

Note that like most code-generators, [Freezed] will need you to both import the annotation ([freezed_annotation])
and use the `part` keyword on the top of your files.

As such, a file that wants to use [Freezed] will start with:

```dart
import 'package:freezed_annotation/freezed_annotation.dart';

part 'my_file.freezed.dart';

```

**CONSIDER** also importing `package:flutter/foundation.dart`.\
The reason being, importing `foundation.dart` also imports classes to make an
object nicely readable in Flutter's devtool.\
If you import `foundation.dart`, [Freezed] will automatically do it for you.
